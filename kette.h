 * This project will be contained in a single header file. The scope
 * of this library is simply to provide a mechanism for implementing linked
 * lists in C. This library was heavily inspired by the Linux kernel's linked
 * list implementation, and I wanted to provide a similar interface for my own
 * projects.
 *
 * The library will provide two types of linked lists: singly linked lists and
 * doubly linked lists. It may be simpler to provide only doubly linked lists,
 * but I did not want force the user to take on unnecessary overhead if they only
 * needed a singly linked list. Functions or macros that are denoted with an 's'
 * at the beginning of the name are for singly linked lists. Functions or macros
 * that are denoted with a 'd' at the beginning of the name are for doubly linked
 * lists. If neither of these prefixes are present, the function or macro is
 * intended to be used for both types of linked lists.
 *
 * Both types of linked lists will be circular. This means that the last node in
 * the list will point to the first node in the list. This is done because there
 * is almost no downside to having a circular list, but there can be many upsides.
 *
 * For a detailed explanation of the functions and macros, see the comments
 * in this file. For an overview of the library with short examples, see the Usage
 * section in the README.md file.
